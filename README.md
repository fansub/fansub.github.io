# [FansubDB.github.io](https://fansubdb.github.io/)

## What is it?
This site has the goal to list all the new airing/streaming anime in Japan, and which subs groups are subbing (or plan to sub) them.

## Is there an API?
It's not really an API.
Our website hosts `JSON` files to load our `HTML` files content.
<br><br>
You can access to it over **GET** on **HTTP** or **HTTPS** on fansub.github.io/`:lang/:years/:season.json`
<br>
* `:lang` can be found on `fansub.github.io/lang.json`
* `:year` and `:season` can be found on `fansubdb.github.io/:lang/list.json` (`:lang` come from above)

## I want to help you.
No problem, do a pull request :)

### How are the json files organized?

#### lang.json, year.json, season.json
* `lang.json` in the root folder, to choose the subs language.
* `list.json` in the `:lang` folder. It indicates where the json file of the season animes is located.

They have an objects table. The object contains each value (lang/year/season) and their url.

#### The json file of the season animes
This file is located under `:lang/:year/:season.json`. (eg. [`fr/2014/automne_TV.json`](fr/2014/automne_TV.json))

It's a unique object which contains: 
* *name*: Translation of the name; **required**; it's the `<th>` of the table
* *group*: Translation of the group; **required**; it's the second `<th>` of the table
* *lbl_tv*: The label of the button to show `tv` list; **required**
* *lbl_ova*: The label of the button to show `ova/ona/special` list; **required**
* *lbl_movie*: The label of the button to show `movie` list; **required**
* *message*: Show the text when the array `tv`, `ova` or `movie` is empty (i.e. contains 0 value)
* *tv*: an array of `anime` objects; **required**.
* *ova*: an array of `anime` objects; **required**.
* *movie*: an array of `anime` objects; **required**.

##### The `Anime` object
An `anime` object contains:
* *name*: **required**; it's the `<td>` of the table, appears in the colum of `name`
* *image* from MyAnimeList link (or livechart exceptionally); **required**; show it when click on the button
* *group* (array) of subs-group which subs it: **required**. An object `group` can have:
	* a *status* (uncertain, planned, release, dropped, simulcast): **required** if `detail` exists (see below);
	* an array named *detail*, where we have the possibility to add co-subbing: **required** if `status` exists. This array contains:
		* the *name* of the group: **required** if `status` exists
		* and its *url* (see [External Links](#external-links)): **optional**

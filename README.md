#Fansub.github.io

##What is it?
This site has the goal to list all the new airing/streaming anime in Japan, and which subs groups are subbing (or plan to sub) them.

##Is there an API?
It's not really an API.
Our website hosts `JSON` files to load our `HTML` files content.
<br><br>
You can access to it over **GET** on **HTTP** or **HTTPS** on fansub.github.io/`:lang/:years/:season.json`
<br>
* `:lang` can be found on `fansub.github.io/lang.json`
* `:year` and `:season` can be found on `fansub.github.io/:lang/list.json` (`:lang` come from above)

##I want to help you.
No problem, do a pull request :)

###How have you organized your json files?

####lang.json, year.json, season.json
* `lang.json` in the root folder, to choose the subs language.
* `list.json` in the `:lang` folder. It indicates where the json file of the season animes is located.

They have an objects table. The object contains each value (lang/year/season) and their url.

####The json file of the season animes
is located under `:lang/:year/:season.json`. (eg. [`fr/2014/automne.json`](fr/2014/automne.json))

It's a unique object which contains three attributs: 
* the *name*: Its value is its translation; **required** ; it's my `<th>` of my table
* the *group*: the same of `name`; **required** ; it's my second `<th>` of my table
* the *anime*: an array of `anime` objects; **required**. An `anime` object contains:
	* a *name*; **required** ; it's my `<td>` of my table, appears in the colum of `name`
	* an *image* from MyAnimeList link (or livechart exceptionally); **required** ; when the anime name is hover
	* a *table* (array) of subs-group which subs it; **required**. An object `group` can have:
		* a *status* (uncertain, planned, release, dropped, simulcast); **required** if `detail` exists (see below);
		* an array named *details*, where we have the possibility to add co-subbing; **required** if `status` exists. This array contains:
			* the *name* of the group; **required** if `status` exists
			* and its *url* (see [External Links](#external-links)); **optional**

#####Simple example of a JSON file
```
{
	"name":"name",
	"group":"fansub group",
	"anime":[{
			"name":"Anime A",
			"image":"URL from MAL of the Anime A",
			"group":[{
				"status":"release",
				"detail":[{
					"name":"SUBS 1",
					"url":"URL of the SUBS 1"
				}]
			}]
	},{
		"name":"Anime B",
		"image":"URL from MAL of the Anime B",
		"group":[{
			"status":"simulcast",
			"detail":[{
				"name":"simulcast 2",
				"url":"URL of the simulcast 2"
			}]
		},{
			"status":"dropped",
			"detail":[{
				"name":"fansub drop 1"
			},{
				"name":"fansub drop 2 in co-subbing with fansub drop 1",
				"url":"and its URL"
			}]
		}]
	}]
}
```

###How edit the JSON file
